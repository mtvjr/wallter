# Wallter ![Foundry VTT: 0.6.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/Foundry%20VTT-0.6.0-yellow?style=plastic)

A module to help alter walls.

## Note: This module is a work in progress. It is not yet optimized.

This module adds keybind to help edit walls in foundry.

While walls are selected, the `arrow keys` will move the walls.
If `shift` is held, the topmost (then leftmost) wall endpoint will move.
If `alt` is held, the bottommost (then rightmost) wall endpoint will move.

## How to Install
